# Box 

Box cutter is a party game utility for quickly viewing and launching popular party game titles from one location.

It was originally intended to be used for the Jackbox Party Pack games, but support has been added for other titles.

Games from the Jackbox Party Packs are launched directly, without the user needing to navigate through the Party Pack's main menu.

## Requirements

The tool only supports games that are available on Steam or through the web browser. For games on Steam, the user must have a valid license to install and play the game. At this time, it is not possible to support games on other services, such as the Epic Games Store.

## Development progress

The following Jackbox Party Pack games need to be tested to verify they launch correctly:
- The Jackbox Party Pack 7 (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 8 (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Starter (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 9 (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 10 (unreleased)

## Known Issues

Drawful and Fibbage, from the original Jackbox Party Pack, do not load correctly. They are not shown within the utility as a result.
