# Box Cutter

Box Cutter is a utility for quickly viewing and launching Jackbox party games from one location.

Party pack games are launched directly, without needing to navigate through a party pack's menu. No game files are modified with this tool.

## Requirements

The tool only supports games that are available on Steam.

The user must have a valid license to install and run the game.

At this time, it is not possible to support games on other services, such as the Epic Games Store.

The [Steam Browser Protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_browser_protocol) must be enabled and working to launch any locally installed games.

## Development progress

The following Jackbox Party Pack games need to be tested to verify they launch correctly:
- The Jackbox Party Pack 7 (all titles, excluding Quiplash 3)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 8 (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Starter (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 9 (all titles)
- The Jackbox Party Pack 10 (unreleased)

## Known Issues

Drawful and Fibbage, from the original Jackbox Party Pack, do not load correctly. They are not shown within the utility as a result.

Exiting a party pack game through the in-game menus will return to the pack's menu. There is no fix for this behavior.
